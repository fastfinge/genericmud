"""Auto-login: watch incoming lines for the name/password prompts and answer them.

Login prompts vary by MUD, so this is heuristic. Two guards keep the stored password
from leaking to the game as a command:

* the password is only sent AFTER the username prompt has been answered, and
* it is only sent to a line that actually looks like a password prompt (anchored:
  ``...password:`` / ``password >`` / a bare ``Password`` line), never any line that
  merely contains the word — a banner like "never share your password" won't fire it,
* and only within a few lines of the name prompt, so a later in-game line mentioning
  "password" can't trigger a send.

The name prompt is watched only near the start of the connection (a generous line
budget), and the whole thing disarms the moment the user sends their own input, so an
in-game line like "by what name do the villagers call you?" can't make it type the
stored username — or arm the password send — deep into a session.

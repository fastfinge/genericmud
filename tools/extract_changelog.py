"""Extract a single version's notes from CHANGELOG.md.

The release workflow runs this to fill the GitHub release *body* at tag time. That body
is not decoration: ``self_update.check_for_update`` returns it verbatim as ``notes``, and
that is the text the in-app update dialog reads out to the user. Before this, every
release carried the same hardcoded "unzip the folder and run genericMud.exe" boilerplate,
so someone being offered an update was told how to install the client they already had
and nothing about what had changed in it.

Usage:
    extract_changelog.py <changelog_path> <version> [output_path]

``version`` accepts the release-tag form (``v0.7.1``) or the bare number (``0.7.1``).
Writes the section to ``output_path`` as UTF-8 when given, else prints it to stdout.
Exits 1 when no section matches, so tagging without writing the notes fails loudly
instead of shipping a release that says nothing.
